# WeatherApp

I have used MVP for architecture design.
Implemented Retrofit to make service call and OkHttp for request interceptor.
Dependency is injected using Dagger 2.

To show the state of loading RotationAnimation class is used.

Slide-up animation is shown for bottom sheet by using Animation class

To change font-face font xml is created using ttf files

Written unit test cases using Mockito

The user is shown the current location average temperature. Runtime permission
is requested to access user location.

P.S. Please check the video I have attached with the email
